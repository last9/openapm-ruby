# Openapm

APM for Rack based Ruby applications using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'openapm'
```

And then execute:

$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

$ gem install openapm

## Usage

### Rack application

```ruby
# config.ru
require 'rack'
require 'openapm/middleware'

use Rack::Deflater
use Openapm::Middleware
```

### Rails application

``` ruby
# config/initializers/openapm.rb

unless Rails.env.test?
  require 'openapm/middleware'

  Rails.application.middleware.unshift Openapm::Middleware
end
```

This will start emitting the RED metrics for HTTP requests on `/metrics` path which can be scraped by a Prometheus.

### Supported labels

1. `path` - HTTP request path, removes id and uuid from the request path.
2. `method` - HTTP method
3. `status` - HTTP status code. Eg. 404
4. `environment` - Rack or Rails enviornment set in the enviornment.
5. `program` - Application name, defaults to `web-application`. Can be customized by setting `Openapm.default_labels` hash.

### Additional labels

You can set additional labels by setting `Openapm.default_labels`

``` ruby
Openapm.default_labels = { service: 'web-service', stack: 'rails', team: 'platform' }
```

These labels will be added to each metric time series by default as static values.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
